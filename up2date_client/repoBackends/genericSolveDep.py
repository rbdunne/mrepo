class GenericSolveDep:
    # so, what exactly does this do? well...
    # this is basically all to work around the fact that
    # when we solve a dep, we know what NVRE solves it
    # but not what arch. This used to not be a problem,
    # as you simply picked the best arch.
    #
    # However, with multilib/biarch, it means we have
    # to do some guessing. Basically, sometimes we only
    # want one arch, sometimes both, sometimes 1 or two
    # of the many arches available
    #
    # the cases where we only want one arch are:
    #    1. the other arch is already installed
    #    2. there is only one arch of that package available
    #    3. the user has specified a --arch, which means
    #       they want a particular arch install overriding 1&2
    #    4. We have both arches isntalled, and one of them
    #       is not the latest
    
    # the cases where we want to install "both" arches
    #    1. we have both arches installed, and there are
    #       newer versions available for both arches
    #    2. we have neither arch installed, but we need
    #       to install both to satisfy deps
    #          a. the same dep applies to both (aka, "libselinux")
    #          b. we have seperate deps that require each arch
    #              (aka, foo.i386 requires libbar.so,
    #                    foo.x86_64 requires libbar.so(64bit)
    #       (to some degree, the later gets done for seperate deps
    #        so doesnt factor into this particular function so
    #        much)
    
    # the cases where we want to install "some" of the arches
    #   These are kernel, glibc, gzip etc where there are
    #   two arch "colors" and more than one arch per color.
    #    aka, glibc.x86_64, glibc.i386, glibc.i686

    # Theres a few basket cases as well, for example when
    # you need to install "foobar" to solve a dep from
    # an x86_64 package and an i386 package. Doing this
    # correctly is further confused by the fact that we
    # dont know what arch of package raises a dep since it
    # is on the transaction as a whole, but we might be
    # able to change that?  WELL... we could... sorta
    # at least on RHEL4/FC3... the release of the package
    # that raises the deps is now actually "release.arch"
    # so thats a possibity, though it doesnt really help
    # us on RHEL2.1/RHEL3. But on RHEL4 we could pass it
    # in as part of the dep and use it as a hint...
